      <i>We are building awesome mobile games. We like to think they donâ€™t suck because we put a lot of attention into each game; details, design, and all that jazz. Each and every game will improve upon the first, ascending in quality to an ultimate point in gaming where we, at Inkhorn, can gladly rest our laurels on. This is Inkhorn and we create games.</i> At Inkhorn I'm responsible for spearheading the development of Lockstep.IO a proprietary open source networking API designed specifically for massively multiplayer online games.
